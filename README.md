#Impossible Octopus Fitness - In Short
Higher-level programming â€• The Twitter clone adventure

With accessibility in mind, and created to work on mobile devices, In Short is a social networking clone that displays statuses, of varying lengths, posted by imaginary people who are represented by images and fake names.

An aside bar provides us with a fake list of the most active users on the platform.
