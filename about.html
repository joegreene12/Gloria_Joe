                    <h1> Impossible Octopus Fitness</h1>
                    <h3>What does this mean? What is Impossible Octopus Fitness?</h3>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Holberton School is in the business of  creating Software Engineers with many different skills. The purpose is to have them able to learn any new technologies that may arise in the future regardless of their initial training. Like the multi tentacled octopus, it means that they will be able to reach out in many different directions to CAPTURE and KEEP information.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>I still don't get it...</h3>
                    <p>Take a minute to watch this:</p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5DyBkYKqnM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>With the size of their brains, (brain fitness!) the Octopus probably already knows what a video camera is for and is planning to upload some of the material to Youtube. Plan ahead!</p>
                    <p>See this impossible feat of Octopus fitness:</p>
                    <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/949eYdEz3Es" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>With the tiniest opportunity infront of it, it performs a feat that would be impossible for man. But the octopus is not only into brain fitness, physical fitness is it's domain as well</p>
                    <p>One more for our amazing visitors:</p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sgHjv7Cz34s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>The octopus makes cheap work of man made traps and contraptions. Something that might be impossible for us, like escaping the jaws of a shark, is not impossible for the fitness octopus.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>I'm sure you're starting to understand</h3>
                    <p>Holberton School is not creating Software Engineers who look like they know how to code, or who can shoulder the strange responsiblities that arise from being and awesome coder. They are creating multi tentacled impossibly fit octopi who can be creative about solutions in ways that seem impossible.</p>
